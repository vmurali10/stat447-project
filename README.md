## Overview

Urban Heat Islands (UHIs) are metropolitan areas that experience significantly higher temperatures than surrounding rural areas due to human activities, concrete infrastructure, and reduced vegetation. This project aims to analyze the relationship between UHIs and public health outcomes, such as heat-related illnesses and respiratory conditions, using a real-world dataset.

We will conduct an end-to-end data analysis, from data collection and cleaning to modeling and visualization, to identify patterns and trends in UHI intensity and its correlation with emergency room visits, hospitalizations, and other health indicators.

## Data Sources

- **NOAA Urban Heat Island Mapping Campaign Data**  
  Provides detailed temperature anomalies in urban areas compared to surrounding rural regions, summarizing environmental and demographic information.

- **NASA Global Urban Heat Island (UHI) Data Set, 2013**  
  Estimates land surface temperature within urban areas and the difference compared to surrounding rural areas.

- **CDC Heat & Health Tracker**  
  Offers local heat and health information, including data on heat-related illnesses, emergency visits, and hospitalizations by region.

## Project Goals

- Aggregate and clean datasets from multiple sources, handling missing data and inconsistencies.
- Identify trends in heat intensity, demographics, and health outcomes.
- Use statistical regression models and clustering techniques to assess the correlation between UHI severity and health indicators.
- Create maps, heatmaps, and time-series plots to highlight geographic and temporal patterns.
- Provide recommendations for mitigating health risks associated with UHIs based on the findings.
